# Utilities Directory

This directory contains supporting scripts for development, maintenance, and reliable data operations only.

## VPA-Strategist Protocol

### Manual Daily Planning Protocol
The Daily Planning Protocol now uses **manual natural language analysis only** as defined in `tasks/DAILY_PLAN.md`.

**No automated text parsing utilities** - All analysis is done through:
- Manual reading of REPORT.md, REPORT_week.md using Read tools
- Manual analysis of hold.md for portfolio foundation  
- Manual signal identification using human intelligence
- Reliable Python only for CSV, JSON basic operations

**Portfolio Foundation:**
The current portfolio holdings from hold.md serve as market leaders:
- CTS, HDB, HDC, MWG, SSI, TCH, VHM, VIX, VND, VPB (market leaders)
- SHB (underperforming, candidate for downgrade)

**NO Automated Files Generated** - Manual analysis replaces all automation

## Reliable Utility Scripts

### `split_tickers.py` ✅ RELIABLE
- **Purpose**: Splits TICKERS.csv into 8 batch files for parallel processing
- **Usage**: `python split_tickers.py`
- **Type**: Pure CSV operations using standard csv module
- **Output**: 8 batch files in `utilities/data/` directory (batch_1.csv through batch_8.csv)
- **Use case**: Parallel processing setup for stock data downloads

### `data/` Directory ✅ RELIABLE
- **Contains**: 8 CSV batch files (batch_1.csv through batch_8.csv)  
- **Purpose**: Ticker lists for parallel processing workflows
- **Type**: Pure CSV data files
- **Generated by**: `split_tickers.py`

## Removed Unreliable Utilities

All text parsing utilities have been removed as they were unreliable:
- ❌ `generate_fact_sheets.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `assess_ticker_states.py` - unreliable text parsing  
- ❌ `validate_group_mappings.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `verify_vpa.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `verify_vpa_week.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `split_vpa.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `vpa_analysis_prep.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `vpa_analysis_prep_week.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `merge_vpa_legacy.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `test_vpa_scanner.py` - unreliable text parsing
- ❌ `verify_dividends.py` - unreliable text parsing

## Usage Notes

- Only reliable CSV/JSON operations remain
- Use manual natural language analysis as defined in `tasks/DAILY_PLAN.md`
- All stock analysis is done through manual reading of reports with human intelligence
