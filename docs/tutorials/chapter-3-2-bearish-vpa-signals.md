```

**Warning Levels:**
- ⭐ = Extreme oversold (potential bottom)
- ⭐⭐ = Moderate bearish (caution)
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Strong bearish (reduce exposure)
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Extremely bearish (exit positions)

## 2. Supply-Based Bearish Signals

### 2.1 High Volume No Progress (HVNP) ⭐⭐⭐

**Definition:** Large volume with minimal price advance, indicating heavy supply absorption

**Technical Criteria:**
- Volume > 200% of 20-day average
- Price advance < 1% despite high volume
- Wide spread but weak close (bottom 40% of range)
- Usually occurs after significant advance

**Market Psychology:**
- Retail buying into institutional selling
- Smart money distributing positions
- Supply overwhelming demand despite appearance of strength

**Case Study: HPG High Volume No Progress (May 30, 2025)**

Từ `vpa_data/HPG.md`:
```
HPG đẩy lên cao 22.21 nhưng đóng cửa chỉ 21.46
Volume: 65.01 triệu (CỰC LỚN) 
Phân tích: "Topping Out Volume hoặc Buying Climax"
```

**Perfect HVNP Analysis:**
- ✅ **Ultra-high volume:** 65.01M (record level)
- ✅ **Wide intraday spread:** High 22.21 vs previous levels  
- ✅ **Weak close:** 21.46 (significantly below high)
- ✅ **Effort vs Result failure:** Massive effort, poor result

**Detection Algorithm:**
```python
def detect_high_volume_no_progress(df, volume_threshold=2.0, weak_close_threshold=0.4):
    """Detect High Volume No Progress patterns"""
    hvnp_signals = []
    
    for i in range(20, len(df)):
        if (df['volume_ratio'].iloc[i] > volume_threshold and
            df['close_position'].iloc[i] < weak_close_threshold and
            df['price_spread'].iloc[i] > df['price_spread'].iloc[i-10:i].mean() * 1.5):
            
            hvnp_signals.append({
                'date': df.index[i],
                'volume_ratio': df['volume_ratio'].iloc[i],
                'close_position': df['close_position'].iloc[i],
                'price_spread': df['price_spread'].iloc[i],
                'warning_level': 'STRONG BEARISH'
            })
    
    return hvnp_signals
```

**Trading Implications:**
- **Immediate:** Reduce position size
- **Stop Loss:** Below day's low
- **Expectation:** Weakness in following sessions
- **Strategy:** Avoid new longs, consider shorts

### 2.2 Upthrust (UT) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Definition:** False breakout above resistance followed by immediate failure

**Technical Criteria:**
- Break above recent significant high
- High volume initially
- Quick reversal back below breakout level
- Close in bottom half of range

**Upthrust Psychology:**
- Final trap for late bulls
- Smart money uses breakout to distribute
- Retail FOMO buying into institutional selling
- Supply revelation at new highs

**Upthrust Detection:**
```python
def detect_upthrust(df, resistance_level, lookback=5):
    """Detect Upthrust patterns"""
    upthrusts = []
    
    for i in range(lookback, len(df)):
        if (df['high'].iloc[i] > resistance_level and  # Break resistance
            df['close'].iloc[i] < resistance_level and  # Close back below
            df['volume_ratio'].iloc[i] > 1.5 and      # High volume
            df['close_position'].iloc[i] < 0.4):      # Weak close
            
            upthrusts.append({
                'date': df.index[i],
                'high': df['high'].iloc[i],
                'close': df['close'].iloc[i],
                'volume_ratio': df['volume_ratio'].iloc[i],
                'failure_magnitude': resistance_level - df['close'].iloc[i]
            })
    
    return upthrusts
```

### 2.3 Supply Overcomes Demand (SOD) ⭐⭐⭐

**Definition:** Heavy selling pressure evidenced by large volume decline

**Technical Criteria:**
- Volume > 150% average on down move
- Wide spread down
- Close near low of day
- Breaks through important support

**Market Meaning:**
- Institutional selling pressure
- Support levels failing
- Demand unable to absorb supply
- Beginning of potential markdown

## 3. Weakness-Based Bearish Signals

Từ `vpa_data/VIC.md`:
```
VIC giá biến động nhẹ và đóng cửa gần như không đổi
Volume: 2.5 triệu (thấp)
Phân tích: "No Demand. Lực cầu vẫn chưa quay trở lại mạnh mẽ"
```

**No Demand Context:**
- Following previous Selling Climax và recovery
- Low volume drift indicating lack of interest
- Neither supply nor demand dominant
- Bearish because buying should appear after SC

### 3.2 Weak Rally (WR) ⭐⭐

**Definition:** Price advance with poor volume và technical characteristics

**Technical Criteria:**

|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Volume** | Decreasing | Increasing |
| **Spread** | Narrow | Wide |
| **Close** | Weak | Strong |
| **Follow-through** | Fails | Continues |
| **Resistance** | Can't break | Easily penetrates |

**Detection Logic:**
```python
def detect_weak_rally(df, volume_decline_threshold=0.8, weak_close_threshold=0.4):
    """Detect Weak Rally patterns"""
    weak_rallies = []
    
    for i in range(5, len(df)):
        if (df['price_change'].iloc[i] > 0.5 and  # Price up
            df['volume_ratio'].iloc[i] < volume_decline_threshold and  # Volume down
            df['close_position'].iloc[i] < weak_close_threshold):  # Weak close
            
            # Check if failing to reach previous high
            recent_high = df['high'].iloc[i-5:i].max()
            if df['high'].iloc[i] < recent_high * 0.98:  # Failing to reach
                weak_rallies.append({
                    'date': df.index[i],
                    'price_change': df['price_change'].iloc[i],
                    'volume_ratio': df['volume_ratio'].iloc[i],
                    'close_position': df['close_position'].iloc[i]
                })
    
    return weak_rallies
```

### 3.3 Effort No Result (ENR) ⭐⭐⭐

**Definition:** High volume with minimal price progress, indicating absorption

**Similar to HVNP but different context:**

- **ENR:** During accumulation phase (absorption)

**Recognition:** High volume, narrow range, middle close

## 4. Distribution-Based Signals

### 4.1 Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Definition:** False breakout above distribution range to trap final buyers

**Technical Criteria:**
- New high above established trading range

**Position Management:**
```python
def calculate_position_risk(bearish_signals):
    """Calculate position risk based on bearish signals"""
    risk_score = 0
    
    for signal in bearish_signals:
        if signal['type'] == 'UTAD':
            risk_score += 4
        elif signal['type'] == 'HVNP':
            risk_score += 3
        elif signal['type'] == 'No Demand':
            risk_score += 1
        elif signal['type'] == 'Weak Rally':
            risk_score += 2
    
    if risk_score >= 6:
        return "HIGH RISK - Consider exiting"
    elif risk_score >= 3:
        return "MODERATE RISK - Reduce position"
    else:
        return "LOW RISK - Monitor"
```
