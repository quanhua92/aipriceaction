## 2. The Distribution Signal - May 15, 2025

### 2.1 The Anomaly Revealed

**From Expert VPA Analysis:**
```
Ngày 2025-05-15: VN-Index tăng nhẹ từ 1309.73 lên 1313.2 (+0.26%)
Volume: 1,048.49 triệu (mức cao nhất trong nhiều tuần)
Phân tích: "Sự bất thường nghiêm trọng. Nỗ lực không mang lại kết quả tương xứng"
```

### 2.2 Effort vs Result Analysis

**Quantitative Breakdown:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Price Change** | +3.47 points (+0.26%) | EXTREMELY LOW |
| **Volume** | 1,048.49M shares | RECORD HIGH |
| **Spread** | Likely narrow range | POOR |
| **Effort/Result Ratio** | 4,031M volume per 1% gain | ANOMALOUS |
| **Historical Context** | Highest volume in weeks | UNUSUAL |

**The Anomaly Explained:**
```python
# Theoretical effort/result calculation
normal_volume_for_advance = 400M  # Typical for 0.26% move
actual_volume = 1048M
anomaly_ratio = actual_volume / normal_volume_for_advance
# Result: 2.62x more volume than needed

# Price efficiency calculation  
volume_per_point = 1048.49M / 3.47  # = 302M per point
# Vs normal: ~50M per point
# 6x inefficiency = Major distribution warning
```
