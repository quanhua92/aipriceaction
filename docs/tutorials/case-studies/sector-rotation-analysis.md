# Case Study: Vietnam Sector Rotation Analysis 2025 - VPA Perspective

## Executive Summary

This case study examines sector rotation patterns in the Vietnamese stock market during 2025, using VPA methodology to identify which sectors smart money was accumulating versus distributing. By analyzing multiple stocks within each sector using our comprehensive dataset, we demonstrate how institutional money flows create rotation opportunities that retail investors typically miss.

**Key Findings:**
- **Banking Sector:** Clear accumulation phase (VCB, TCB patterns)
- **Steel Sector:** Distribution signals evident (HPG topping action)
- **Real Estate:** Mixed signals với pockets of accumulation (VIC patterns)
- **Technology:** Early distribution/late markup signs
- **Consumer:** Defensive accumulation beginning

## 1. Sector Rotation Theory və VPA

### 1.1 Why Sectors Rotate

**Economic Cycle Drivers:**
- Interest rate changes affect sectors differently
- Currency fluctuations impact export vs domestic
- Government policy shifts favor certain industries
- Foreign investment flows target specific sectors

**Smart Money Behavior:**
- Institutional investors rotate 6-12 months ahead
- Create sector trends through concentrated buying/selling
- Use VPA signals to identify rotation timing
- Volume patterns reveal institutional activity

### 1.2 VPA Sector Analysis Framework

**Sector Health Assessment:**
```python
def analyze_sector_vpa_health(sector_stocks):
    """Analyze VPA signals across sector"""
    
    sector_score = 0
    total_stocks = len(sector_stocks)
    
    for stock in sector_stocks:
        # Load stock data
        data = load_stock_data(stock)
        vpa_data = calculate_vpa_indicators(data)
        recent = vpa_data.tail(30)  # Last 30 days
        
        # Count bullish signals
        bullish_count = 0
        bullish_count += len(recent[recent['volume_ratio'] > 1.8])  # High vol days
        bullish_count += len(recent[(recent['volume_ratio'] > 1.5) & 
                                  (recent['close_position'] > 0.7)])  # Strong closes
        
        # Count bearish signals  
        bearish_count = 0
        bearish_count += len(recent[(recent['volume_ratio'] > 1.8) & 
                                   (recent['close_position'] < 0.3)])  # Weak closes
        
        # Net score for this stock
        stock_score = bullish_count - bearish_count
        sector_score += stock_score
    
    # Average score per stock
    sector_health = sector_score / total_stocks
    
    if sector_health > 2:
        return "ACCUMULATION - Smart Money Buying"
    elif sector_health < -2:
        return "DISTRIBUTION - Smart Money Selling"

*💡 **Master Insight:** Sector rotation is not random - it's driven by smart money flows that leave clear VPA footprints. By analyzing multiple stocks within each sector, we can identify where institutional money is accumulating versus distributing. The key is recognizing these patterns early và positioning accordingly, rather than chasing performance after trends become obvious to everyone.*
