```

## 3. Phase C: Perfect VPA Sequence (June 2025)

### 3.1 No Supply Signal - June 11, 2025

**From Expert VPA Analysis:**
```
Ngày 2025-06-11: LPB có một phiên giao dịch đi ngang với biên độ nến cực hẹp. 
Khối lượng giao dịch đã cạn kiệt, chỉ còn 0.95 triệu đơn vị, mức thấp nhất 
trong một thời gian rất dài.

Phân tích VPA/Wyckoff: "No Supply (Không có Nguồn Cung) rõ ràng. Không còn 
ai muốn bán ra nữa. Điều kiện tiên quyết thuận lợi cho việc giá có thể tăng trở lại"
```

**Perfect No Supply Characteristics:**
- **Volume Exhaustion:** 0.95M shares (lowest in months)
- **Price Stability:** Narrow range trading
- **Supply Absence:** No sellers at current levels
- **Setup Quality:** Textbook accumulation signal

**Critical Recognition:**
This was one of the clearest No Supply signals in the entire market during 2025. The volume drop to 0.95M was dramatic and signaled complete selling exhaustion.

### 3.2 Test for Supply - June 13, 2025

**From VPA Analysis:**
```
Ngày 2025-06-13: Giá gần như không đổi nhưng khối lượng giao dịch tăng đột biến 
trở lại (3.0 triệu đơn vị) so với phiên "No Supply" trước đó.

Phân tích: "Test for Supply (Kiểm tra Nguồn cung). Dòng tiền thông minh 
đang kiểm tra xem liệu còn lực bán nào còn sót lại hay không"
```

**Professional Testing Process:**
- **Volume Increase:** From 0.95M to 3.0M (+215%)
- **Price Response:** No decline despite volume spike
- **Interpretation:** Smart money testing supply
- **Result:** Confirmed - no sellers remaining

**Why This Test Was Critical:**
- Proved No Supply signal was genuine
- Smart money actively probing market
- Volume tolerance test passed
- Set up for Sign of Strength

### 3.3 Sign of Strength - June 17, 2025

**From Expert Analysis:**
```
Ngày 2025-06-17: LPB tăng vọt từ 31.65 lên 32.35. Cây nến có biên độ rất rộng, 
đóng cửa ở mức cao nhất phiên. Khối lượng giao dịch tăng mạnh lên 4.0 triệu đơn vị.

Phân tích: "Sign of Strength (SOS), là kết quả của các tín hiệu No Supply và 
Test for Supply thành công trước đó. Xu hướng tăng mới có thể đã bắt đầu"
```

**SOS Excellence:**
- **Price Advance:** +2.2% explosive move
- **Volume Confirmation:** 4.0M shares (institutional buying)
- **Range Character:** Wide range up day
- **Close Position:** At highs (professional strength)

**Sequence Perfection:**
The No Supply → Test → SOS sequence was textbook Wyckoff methodology in perfect action.

## 4. Phase D: Markup Confirmation (June 18-25, 2025)

### 4.1 Test for Supply Success - June 18, 2025

**From VPA Analysis:**
```
Ngày 2025-06-18: LPB giảm từ 32.35 xuống 31.95. Khối lượng giảm (1.94 triệu đơn vị) 
so với phiên SOS.
Phân tích: "Test for Supply sau phiên bùng nổ. Việc khối lượng giảm trong phiên 
điều chỉnh là một dấu hiệu tốt"
```

**Post-SOS Testing:**
- Natural pullback after explosive advance
- Volume declining on weakness (bullish)
- Higher low formation (32.35 → 31.95)
- Professional profit-taking absorption

### 4.2 Effort to Rise Confirmation - June 19, 2025

**From Expert Analysis:**
```
Ngày 2025-06-19: LPB tăng từ 31.95 lên 32.4. Nến tăng có biên độ rộng. 
Khối lượng giao dịch tăng (2.73 triệu đơn vị).
