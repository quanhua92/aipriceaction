## What is aipa

`aipa` is an AI-powered financial analysis CLI for Vietnamese stocks, cryptocurrencies, and global assets. It combines OHLCV price data with LLM analysis to produce actionable trading insights using frameworks like Wyckoff, VPA (Volume Price Analysis), and MA momentum scoring.

## Installation

```bash
# One-time use (no install needed)
uvx aipa-cli analyze VCB

# Persistent install
uv tool install aipa-cli
aipa analyze VCB
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes (for AI) | — | API key for the LLM provider |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | No | OpenRouter | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible API |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | No | `openrouter/owl-alpha` | Model to use for analysis |

Run `aipa setup` for interactive first-run configuration. Settings are saved to `~/.aipriceaction/settings.json`.

## Available Data Sources

- **Vietnamese stocks** (`source: vn`): VIC, VCB, FPT, HPG, VNM, MBB, TCB, CTG, VPB, HDB, etc.
- **Cryptocurrencies** (`source: crypto`): BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, BNBUSDT, SOLUSDT, etc.
- **Global/Yahoo** (`source: global/yahoo`): AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, SPY, etc.
- **SJC Gold** (`source: sjc`): SJC gold prices

### Supported Intervals

| Interval | Description |
|---|---|
| `1m` | 1 minute |
| `5m` | 5 minutes |
| `15m` | 15 minutes |
| `30m` | 30 minutes |
| `1h` | 1 hour |
| `4h` | 4 hours |
| `1D` | 1 day (default) |
| `1W` | 1 week |

Note: All intervals work natively — `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1D`, `1W`, `2W`. Non-native intervals are aggregated client-side from base data.

## When to Use This Skill vs Others

| User Request | Use |
|---|---|
| "Analyze VCB" | `aipa analyze VCB` |
| "Compare FPT and VNM" | `aipa analyze FPT VNM` |
| "Wyckoff analysis for HPG" | `aipa analyze HPG --question "Wyckoff analysis with phases, events, and price targets"` |
| "Research the banking sector deeply" | Use the `aipa-research` skill instead |
| "Get price data for VCB" | Use the `aipa-data` skill instead |
| "Show me OHLCV candles for BTC" | Use the `aipa-data` skill instead |
| "What are the top stocks today?" | `aipa live-data` (no AI, quick market overview) |
| "Top gainers / losers" | `aipa performers` (no AI) |
| "Best stocks by trading value" | `aipa performers --sort-by value` (no AI) |
| "Volume profile / POC / value area" | `aipa volume-profile TICKER` (no AI) |
| "What banking stocks are available?" | `aipa ticker-list --source vn --group NGAN_HANG` |

Key rule: **AI insights → `aipa-analyze`, raw numbers → `aipa-data`, comprehensive report → `aipa-research`, quick market overview → `aipa live-data`**.

## Question Templates

The CLI includes pre-built analysis question templates organized by framework. Use `--questions` to list all available templates.

### Single-Ticker Templates (English)

| Index | Template | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Trading Opportunity | Wyckoff phases, Smart Money behavior, deployment roadmap, risk management |
| 1 | News & Events Research | Detect extreme moves (>6.7% or Volume >150%), web search for causes |
| 2 | Price Action & Volume | VPA analysis, smart money footprints, supply/demand zones |
| 3 | MA Momentum & Trend | MA alignment, crossover detection, volume confirmation |
| 4 | Wyckoff Method | Wyckoff phases, Spring/Upthrust/SOS events, price targets |
| 5 | Bob Volman Price Action | Micro pullback entries, breakout/fading setups, trade planning |

### Multi-Ticker Templates (English)

| Index | Template | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Trading Opportunity | Analyze all tickers, rank by opportunity quality |
| 1 | Stock Performance Comparison | Compare price action strength, MA momentum, volume |
| 2 | Market Trend Analysis | Sector rotation via MA scores, accumulation/distribution |
| 3 | Risk & Support/Resistance | Map S/R levels with volume context |
| 4 | News & Events Research | Detect extreme moves across multiple tickers |
| 5 | Bob Volman Price Action | Applied to multiple tickers with ranking |
| 6 | Wyckoff Method | Multi-ticker Wyckoff analysis with ranking |

Vietnamese translations exist for all templates (use `--lang vn`).

### Using Templates

```bash
# List all templates
aipa analyze --questions

# Use a specific template by index (TUI only: /analyze VCB 2)
# In CLI, use --question for custom questions
aipa analyze HPG --question "Phân tích theo phương pháp Wyckoff: xác định pha, sự kiện quan trọng (Spring/Upthrust/SOS), mục tiêu giá và xác nhận khối lượng"
```

## Interpreting Output

The CLI outputs to two streams:

- **stdout**: The final analysis result (the AI's response). This is what you should present to the user.
- **stderr**: Status messages with structured markers for tracking progress.

### Status Markers (stderr)

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[build]` | Context building status and timing |
| `[analyze]` | Analysis question being sent to the LLM |
| `[tool]` | Tool call being executed (e.g., fetching OHLCV data) |
| `[tool-result]` | Tool execution result returned |
| `[thinking]` | Agent reasoning tokens (only with `--verbose`) |
| `[error]` | Error message |
| `[done]` | Analysis complete, includes total time |
| `[result]` | Final analysis output follows |

When presenting results to the user, always use the stdout output (after the `[result]` marker in stderr).

---

## No API Key — Agent Fallback

When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, `aipa analyze` prints the raw context to stdout and exits with `[info]` messages instead of an error. The context contains all the OHLCV data, MA scores, and market metadata needed for analysis.

**If you are an AI agent and see this fallback output, you should perform the analysis yourself** using the printed context:

1. Read the OHLCV data, MA scores, and market context from the stdout output
2. Apply the same analytical framework the CLI would have used (Wyckoff, VPA, MA momentum, etc.)
3. Produce the analysis result as if the LLM agent had generated it
4. Present the result to the user in the same format the CLI normally would

The context output is identical to `aipa analyze --context-only`, so treat it as your input data and do the reasoning yourself.

---

## Tips for AI Agents

1. **Auto-uppercase**: Ticker symbols are automatically converted to uppercase. You can pass `vcb`, `btcusdt`, etc. — they will be treated as `VCB`, `BTCUSDT`.

2. **Use `--context-only` for data inspection**: If you only need to see what data is available without spending API credits, use `aipa analyze VCB --context-only`.

3. **Default is good enough**: The default template (index 0, Trading Opportunity) is comprehensive. Only specify `--question` when the user has a specific analytical framework in mind.

4. **Multi-ticker for comparisons**: When the user asks to "compare" or "which is better", pass multiple tickers: `aipa analyze VCB TCB MBB`.

5. **Use `--lang vn` for Vietnamese users**: If the user writes in Vietnamese or asks for Vietnamese output, add `--lang vn`.

6. **Use `--verbose` for transparency**: When the user wants to see the reasoning process, add `--verbose`.

7. **`aipa-data` for raw numbers**: If the user asks for "price data", "candle data", or "OHLCV" without wanting AI analysis, use the `aipa-data` skill instead.

8. **Interval matters**: For intraday analysis, use `1h` or `4h`. For swing trading, use `1D`. For scalping, use `15m` or `5m`.

9. **Combine with `--limit`**: More bars = more context. Use `--limit 50` or `--limit 100` for deeper analysis. Default is 20.

10. **Reference ticker**: Auto-detected based on the ticker's source — `VNINDEX` for VN stocks, `BTCUSDT` for crypto, `^GSPC` for global stocks. Use `--reference-ticker` to override.

11. **Use `aipa performers` to find tickers to analyze — run multiple perspectives**: When the user asks "what should I analyze?" or "what's moving today?", run `aipa performers` with multiple `--sort-by` values to get a multi-perspective view. **Always run at least these two**: default (price change) and value (trading value). Add MA scores when the user cares about trends. Cross-referencing the lists reveals more significant tickers. Then analyze the interesting ones with `aipa analyze`.

    ```bash
    aipa performers                                          # price change — top gainers / worst losers
    aipa performers --sort-by value                          # trading value — where the money flows
    aipa performers --sort-by ma50_score                     # MA50 trend — strongest/weakest medium-term trends
    aipa performers --sort-by ma20_score                     # MA20 trend — strongest/weakest short-term trends
    aipa performers --sort-by total_money_changed            # money flow change — unusual capital activity
    aipa performers --source crypto --sort-by value          # crypto by trading value
    aipa performers --group NGAN_HANG --sort-by value        # banking sector by trading value
    aipa performers --group CHUNG_KHOAN --sort-by close_changed  # securities sector top gainers
    ```

12. **Use `aipa volume-profile` for support/resistance context**: When analyzing a ticker and the user asks about key price levels, support, resistance, or "where is the volume?", run `aipa volume-profile TICKER` to get POC (Point of Control), value area, and volume-weighted statistics. This gives you concrete price levels to reference in your analysis. Examples:
    - `aipa volume-profile VCB` — today's profile
    - `aipa volume-profile VCB --date 2026-05-08` — specific date
    - `aipa volume-profile VCB --start-date 2026-05-05 --end-date 2026-05-09` — date range
    - `aipa volume-profile BTCUSDT --source crypto --bins 30` — crypto with fewer bins
    - `aipa volume-profile FPT --start-date 2026-05-01 --end-date 2026-05-09 --bins 30 --value-area-pct 80` — full options
