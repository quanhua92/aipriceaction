# AI Price Action Web Frontend - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This is a comprehensive 5-stage implementation plan for building a React web frontend for the AI Price Action Vietnamese stock market analysis project. The frontend will be a client-side only application that reads data directly from the GitHub repository.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: TanStack Router
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 + ShadCN UI
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Data Processing**: Papa Parse (CSV), React Markdown
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Key Features

### Data Sources
1. **VPA.md** - Daily VPA analysis
2. **VPA_week.md** - Weekly VPA analysis  
3. **REPORT.md** - Daily ticker reports
4. **REPORT_week.md** - Weekly ticker reports
5. **PLAN.md** - Main trading plan (entry point)
6. **LEADER.md** - Group leader analysis
7. **GROUP.md** - Industry groupings
8. **IMPACT.md** - Market impact analysis
9. **FUNDS.md** - Fund analysis
10. **hold.md** - Private portfolio (non-trivial URL)
11. **stock_market_cap.csv** - Market capitalization data
12. **TICKERS.csv** - Analyzed tickers list
13. **market_data/** - Daily CSV data for each ticker
14. **market_data_week/** - Weekly CSV data for each ticker

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Charts**: JavaScript-based candlestick charts with volume
- **Time Toggle**: Switch between daily and weekly data views
- **Ticker Search**: Searchable ticker list with favorites
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive layout
- **Real-time Data**: Direct GitHub API integration with caching
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags and performance optimization

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- Initialize React + Vite + TypeScript project
- Configure TanStack Router and Query
- Set up Tailwind CSS 4 and ShadCN UI
- Configure development environment
- Set up Vercel deployment configuration

### Stage 2: Data Services and Chart Integration  
- Create data service layer for GitHub API integration
- Implement CSV parsing for market data
- Build markdown parsing utilities
- Create interactive chart components with Recharts
- Set up error handling and caching strategies

### Stage 3: Core Components and Routing
- Build main layout with navigation and search
- Set up all application routes
- Create core UI components using ShadCN
- Implement state management with Zustand
- Add responsive design and mobile support

### Stage 4: Page Components and Views
- Create HomePage dashboard with overview
- Build PlanPage as main entry point
- Implement VPAPage for analysis viewing
- Create individual TickerPage with charts and data
- Build all content pages (Reports, Leaders, etc.)
- Add HoldPage with restricted access

### Stage 5: Deployment and Testing
- Configure production Vercel deployment
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Implement performance optimizations
- Add SEO and meta tag configuration
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Configure security headers and monitoring

## Execution Instructions

Each stage should be completed sequentially. Each stage file contains:

- **Detailed implementation steps** with code examples
- **Complete file contents** for new files
- **Git diff format** for file modifications  
- **Testing strategies** for verification
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues
- **Fallback options** if primary approach fails

### Getting Started

1. Start with `stage-1-project-setup.md`
2. Follow each stage in order
3. Test thoroughly after each stage
4. Use the troubleshooting sections for issues
5. Verify all features work before deploying

### Key Implementation Notes

- **No Backend Required**: All data fetched directly from GitHub
- **Client-side Caching**: Smart caching to minimize API calls
- **Production Ready**: Full deployment and monitoring setup
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript implementation
- **Performance Optimized**: Code splitting and lazy loading
- **SEO Friendly**: Meta tags and social media optimization

## Data Architecture

```
GitHub Repository (quanhua92/aipriceaction)
└── Raw Files
    ├── Markdown Files (*.md) → Parsed to structured content
    ├── CSV Files (market_data/*) → Parsed to chart data
    ├── Configuration (*.json, *.csv) → App configuration
    └── Images (reports/*) → Optional fallback charts
```

## Expected Outcomes

After completion, you will have:

- **Production-ready web application** deployed on Vercel
- **Interactive data visualization** with real-time updates
- **Comprehensive testing suite** with good coverage
- **Mobile-responsive design** that works on all devices
- **SEO-optimized pages** for search engine visibility
- **Performance-optimized** loading and caching
- **Secure implementation** with proper headers and CSP

## Support and Troubleshooting

Each stage includes:
- Common error solutions
- Alternative implementation approaches  
- Performance optimization tips
- Debugging strategies
- Fallback options for critical failures

The plan is designed to be executed by an AI agent with minimal human intervention, with comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies built in.

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All 12 data sources successfully integrated
- ✅ Interactive charts working for all tickers
- ✅ Search and filtering functional
- ✅ Mobile responsive design verified
- ✅ Performance targets met (LCP < 3s)
- ✅ All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- ✅ Production deployment successful
- ✅ SEO and security headers configured

Execute each stage methodically and verify all requirements before proceeding to the next stage.
