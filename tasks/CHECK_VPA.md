# VPA Duplicate Analysis Check and Fix Task Plan

## Overview
This document provides a systematic approach to identify and fix duplicate VPA analyses in ticker files. Duplicate analyses occur when the same date has multiple conflicting VPA interpretations.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Identification
1. **Scan for Duplicates**
   - Search all files in `/Volumes/data/workspace/aipriceaction/vpa_data/` for duplicate date entries
   - Look for patterns: `- **Ngày YYYY-MM-DD:**` appearing multiple times
   - Identify conflicting VPA signals on the same date

### Phase 2: Market Data Analysis
For each duplicate found:

1. **Locate Market Data File**
   ```bash
   find /Volumes/data/workspace/aipriceaction -name "*{TICKER}*" -type f
   ```

2. **Extract Relevant Market Data**
   ```bash
   grep -A 5 -B 5 "YYYY-MM-DD" /Volumes/data/workspace/aipriceaction/market_data/{TICKER}_*.csv
   ```

3. **Analyze Price/Volume Data**
   - Previous close price
   - Current day: Open, High, Low, Close
   - Price change (% and absolute)
   - Volume change (% and absolute)
   - Context from 2-3 days before

### Phase 3: VPA Signal Determination
Apply VPA logic systematically:

#### Signal Priority Rules:
1. **Price Up + Volume Down** = `No Supply` (supply exhausted)
2. **Price Down + Volume Up** = `Effort to Fall` (selling pressure)
3. **Price Up + Volume Up** = `Sign of Strength` or `Effort to Rise`
4. **Price Down + Volume Down** = `No Demand` (lack of buying interest)
5. **Price flat + Volume patterns** = Various test signals

#### Context Considerations:
- **After Buying Climax**: Next signal likely `Test for Supply`
- **After Sign of Weakness**: Next signal likely `Test for Demand`
- **After Test Success**: Continuation signals (`No Supply`/`No Demand`)
- **Sequence Logic**: Signals should follow logical VPA progression

### Phase 4: Resolution Logic

#### Decision Matrix:
| Scenario | Keep Analysis | Remove Analysis |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Conflicting signals (e.g., `No Supply` vs `Test for Supply`) | Market data matches behavior | Contradicts price/volume action |
| Similar signals (e.g., `SOS` vs `Effort to Rise`) | More specific/accurate signal | Generic/less precise signal |
| Sequence errors | Follows VPA logic sequence | Breaks VPA sequence logic |

#### Common Corrections:
- **Price Up + Volume Down** after climax = `No Supply` (NOT `Test for Supply`)
- **Price Down + Volume Down** = `No Demand` (NOT `No Supply`)
- **Strong price moves + high volume** = `SOS`/`SOW` (NOT `Effort` signals)

### Phase 5: File Editing

1. **Read VPA File**
   ```
   Read file: /Volumes/data/workspace/aipriceaction/vpa_data/{TICKER}.md
   ```

2. **Identify Duplicate Block**
   - Find all entries for the target date
   - Determine which analysis is correct based on Phase 3-4

3. **Remove Incorrect Analysis**
   ```
   Edit file: Remove the entire duplicate block including:
   - Date line: `- **Ngày YYYY-MM-DD:**`
   - Analysis line: `- **Phân tích VPA/Wyckoff:**`
   ```

4. **Fix Cross-References**
   - Search for references to the removed signal in subsequent dates
   - Update references to point to the correct remaining signal
   - Ensure narrative flow remains logical

### Phase 6: Validation

1. **Check Signal Sequence**
   - Verify the remaining signals follow logical VPA progression
   - Ensure no broken references to removed signals

2. **Verify Market Data Alignment**
   - Confirm remaining analysis matches actual price/volume behavior
   - Check that context references are accurate

## Implementation Checklist

For each ticker with duplicates:

- [ ] **Step 1**: Identify duplicate date and conflicting signals
- [ ] **Step 2**: Extract market data for target date and context
- [ ] **Step 3**: Analyze price/volume behavior using VPA rules
- [ ] **Step 4**: Determine which analysis is correct based on decision matrix
- [ ] **Step 5**: Remove incorrect analysis from VPA file
- [ ] **Step 6**: Fix any cross-references in subsequent entries
- [ ] **Step 7**: Validate final result for logical consistency

## Common Error Patterns

### Pattern 1: Post-Climax Confusion
- **Error**: Calling `Test for Supply` when it should be `No Supply`
- **Fix**: If price continues up with reduced volume after climax → `No Supply`

### Pattern 2: Signal Inversion
- **Error**: Calling `No Supply` when it should be `No Demand`
- **Fix**: If price down + volume down → `No Demand`

### Pattern 3: Sequence Breaks
- **Error**: Jumping from `SOW` directly to `SOS` without test phases
- **Fix**: Insert appropriate test signals based on market data

## Quality Assurance

After each fix:
1. Read through 3-5 surrounding dates to ensure narrative flow
2. Verify signal progression follows VPA methodology
3. Confirm all cross-references are updated
4. Check that analysis tone matches signal (bullish/bearish/neutral)

## Batch Processing Notes

When processing multiple tickers:
- Focus on high-impact trading positions first
- Group by date (most duplicates on 2025-07-17)
- Document any systemic patterns for future prevention
- Maintain todo list to track progress

## Success Criteria

A successful fix should result in:

### **⚠️ CRITICAL Data Accuracy Criteria (Must Pass)**
- ✅ **ALL price claims verified** against CSV data
- ✅ **ALL volume claims verified** against CSV data
- ✅ **ALL percentage calculations verified** as mathematically correct
- ✅ **ALL price movements verified** against actual OHLC data
- ✅ **ALL volume directions verified** against actual volume trends
- ✅ **NO data accuracy errors** remaining in any analysis

### **Traditional VPA Criteria (After Data Accuracy)**
- ✅ Single VPA analysis per date
- ✅ Analysis matches price/volume behavior **EXACTLY**
- ✅ Logical signal sequence maintained **WITH VERIFIED DATA**
- ✅ No broken cross-references
- ✅ Consistent narrative flow
- ✅ **ALL VPA signals based on VERIFIED conditions**

## **⚠️ Tools Required**
- Read tool for VPA and CSV files
- MultiEdit tool for batch corrections
- TodoWrite tool for progress tracking
- Basic calculator for percentage verification
- **Task tool for comprehensive verification** when checking multiple tickers

## **⚠️ Error Prevention Guidelines**

### **Critical Data Accuracy Standards**
- **⚠️ ZERO TOLERANCE**: No price/volume claims without CSV verification
- **⚠️ MANDATORY CALCULATION CHECK**: All percentages must be mathematically verified
- **⚠️ VOLUME UNIT CONSISTENCY**: Always convert CSV units to millions correctly
- **⚠️ PRICE MOVEMENT ACCURACY**: All "từ X lên Y" claims must match CSV exactly

### **Emergency Procedures**

If **ANY of these critical issues found**:
- **>3 price movement errors** in any ticker
- **>2 volume direction errors** in any ticker  
- **>5 percentage calculation errors** across all tickers
- **Systematic data pipeline issues**

**EMERGENCY ACTIONS:**
1. **STOP all trading** based on current VPA analysis
2. **Run comprehensive verification** using Task tool for all portfolio tickers
3. **Fix all data errors** before any duplicate resolution
4. **Document systematic patterns** for pipeline improvement
5. **Regenerate analysis** if errors are widespread
