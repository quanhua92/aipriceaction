The market_data.txt includes all the CSV file for each ticker. The goal is to add new lines to "VPA.md" for the corresponding ticker using the same style as existing analysis (especially VNINDEX format).
Process all the tickers. Some tickers are not in VPA.md, so please add those tickers. Make sure you sort tickers by name. Also, try not to update existing analysis to be consistent and you can admit if old analysis is incorrect in the new line instead. If nothing is new for a ticker then you can skip it. 
I want you to give me a self-contained "VPA_NEW.md" that contains only the NEW data for each ticker. Please keep the same format with "VPA.md" so I can merge "VPA.md" and "VPA_NEW.md" later easier. Do not mess up with the format. Do not use canvas. Do not say anything else. Do not add reference or citations. Do not remove old analysis.
